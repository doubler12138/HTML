        Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places ont the way:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
        <li>Magic City, ID</li>
        <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
        <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
        <li>Why, AZ</li>
        <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>

        I saw some Burma Shave style signs onthe side of the road today:
        <q>Passing cars, When you coan't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity.</q>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.

        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finallly got everyting packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
        I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>cell phone</li>
        <li>iPod</li>
        <li>digital camera</li>
        <li>and a protein bar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey ofa thousand miles begins with one Segway</q>
